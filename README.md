# Antimatter Arena #

*A game created for ludum dare 39.*

Millenia ago, the $SYSTEM_NAME system faced an exitential threat:
A gigantic antimatter cloud was set to collide wit the system,
dissolving all matter in it.

To avert disaster, the $ALIEN_RACE, an ancient and highly advanced
civilization, built a powerful deflector shield that protected the
worlds of $SYSTEM_NAME.

But their guardians have long since vanished, and all knowledge of their
construction has been lost. Without maintenance, the device is slowly
running out of power, weakening the shield and letting more and more
antimatter leak into the system.

Unaware of that, the inhabitants of $REDNECK_PLANET set out to enjoy
their annual gladiator tournament, but the arena, thanks to the
effect of the antimatter, is not structurally sound anymore...
